   Which turns into:
     <tag-name attribute=\"value\">child text<child-tag ... /> ...</tag-name>
   Tag and attribute name symbols are downcased; strings are not. If you need
   an upper case tag name, use a string instead of a symbol. Attribute names
   must be keywords and are always downcased.
   Note that this doesn't allow you to format arbitrary S-expressions as XML,
   nor does it allow you to output arbitrary XML via S-expressions. It's only
   meant for use with the kind of XML that WebParser outputs.
